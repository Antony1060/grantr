                    <p>
                        Aave Grants DAO is a community-led grants program to
                        fund ideas submitted by the Aave protocolâ€™s community,
                        with a focus on empowering a wider network of community
                        developers. The community has allocated $1 million per
                        quarter for two quarters for funding grants. The program
                        will run from May 10 to November 10. The grants program
                        was created after a community discussion, which can be
                        found on Aave's governance forum here.
