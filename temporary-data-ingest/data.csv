Algorand Foundation,Algorand uses a unique variation of Proof of Stake called Pure Proof of Stake (PPoS). PPoS is a highly democratized PoS consensus mechanism with a low minimum staking requirement for participating in and securing the network — only one ALGO coin is needed to participate.,https://algorandfoundation.submittable.com/submit/222728/supagrants-dev-tooling-suite,,"June 10, 2022 1:46 PM","Developer experience matters more than ever. In other words, developers expect a stellar experience when building blockchain applications at every stage of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

Therefore, the Algorand Foundation is leading an effort to develop a world-class open-source developer tooling suite. Such a suite includes IDE, static analysis, debugging, account management, automated testing (using the Algorand sandbox), a smart contract library, a block explorer for private blockchain development, tools to help with continuous integration and development. You can compare this developer tooling suite to the https://trufflesuite.com/ or https://hardhat.org/ for Ethereum development.

We expect the suite to integrate existing available tools and IDEs (such as sandbox, https://algobuilder.dev/, https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15300-algodea-algorand-integration, Algorand VS Code extension) as well as newly developed tools. In particular, teams are expected to collaborate with each other to ensure the resulting dev tooling suite is as integrated, user-friendly, and extensible as possible. The Algorand Foundation will play the role of moderators between the teams.

We are looking for teams of blockchain developers who have previous experience with smart contracts, as well as relevant expertise and experience. In particular, we expect teams developing auditing tools and static code analysis tools to include experts in programming languages and in static analysis.

Teams may develop one or multiple new open source tools (e.g., static analyzer) and/or help improving or extending existing tools (such as sandbox, the VS Code Algorand extension, or the AlgoSearch block explorer). They must ensure that their tools can be easily integrated with the other tools in a seamless as possible way. The Algorand Foundation will oversee all the projects and ensure the above.
Proposals for a full suite of open source tools for a specific purpose, such as web IDE à la Ethereum Remix, are also welcome. The Algorand Foundation strongly recommends that these proposals make best use of the existing tools whenever possible.

[PLEASE NOTE] Any applications unrelated to Dev Tooling will be automatically rejected!

All proposed tools must be open source (ideally MIT license) from the get-go and the development itself must take place on a public open source repo (such as a public github). The code must be of outstanding quality, have excellent documentation (both for users of the tools and for potential contributors), and more generally follow best practices (including but not limited to having good unit test coverage, having a proper CI/CD pipeline, and using sparingly external dependencies). In addition, teams should have a positive attitude towards external contributions (which in particular means having clear contributing guidelines)  and ideally should foster an open source community around the project.
The Algorand Foundation wants to create and maintain a strong long-term relationship with the successful teams and expects successful teams to continue maintaining their tools in the long term.

Application Process

We focus on the following aspects:
1. Quality and Completeness of the application - the more detail the better.

2. Structure and Feasibility: Is there a clear execution plan, detailed information about deliverables and milestones, and a reasonable development timeline, and does the applicant or team have what it takes to deliver.

3. Strategy and Innovation: Will the project bring value and benefits to the Algorand ecosystem; does it deliver something unique that will attract new users or is a proven success on other chains. Will your project make a considerable improvement to our existing knowledge or infrastructure.

Timeline
Week 1 - 3: Internal Review of Project Proposal
Week 3: Decision to Accept / Decline Shared
Week 4: Legal Review
Week 5: Formal Contract Signed
Week 6: Initial Payment 

This is a tentative project timeline and may be subject to delays as a result of high volume of applications or clarifications to the proposal etc.

Criteria For Approval

Prior to applying, we strongly advise you to read the https://prismic-io.s3.amazonaws.com/algorandfoundation/9c03c208-80cf-4c43-9dfc-3cfeeb9a8d70_ALGO+Grant+Program+-+Terms+and+Conditions+-11012020.pdf of the Grants Program. We recommend that the Grant amount requested is appropriate to the level of complexity and effort that you intend to deliver. 
Please bear in mind that the more detail you provide the better your chances are of getting funded. It is worth framing your proposal in terms of the benefit and value you will bring to our ecosystem. We look at your proposed milestones and deliverables as evaluation and award criteria so these should be as detailed as possible. 

During the evaluation process, a reviewer may reach out to you for clarification or in person discussion to discuss specific details such as timelines, deliverables, milestones or technical aspect of the application under review.

Our latest product, Aztec Connect, gives developers the tools to offer private trading, lending, borrowing, and earning. Our zero-knowledge rollup and bridge contracts batch transactions together, interact with existing smart contracts on mainnet, and split the gas cost across users in the rollup — resulting in up to 100x gas savings and ironclad privacy.

Our community has been critical to https://ignition.aztecprotocol.com/, https://twitter.com/aztecnetwork/status/1458519218404667393, and https://twitter.com/aztecnetwork/status/1453773884663099392 - and our community will be essential in building the Aztec ecosystem. Since sharing the Aztec Connect Starter a few weeks ago, the community has already started building bridge contracts for protocols including https://github.com/0xinugami/aztec-lido-bridge/blob/master/contracts/LidoBridge.sol, https://github.com/bertmiller/aztec-connect-bridge-contracts, and Compound.
We are launching a grant program to provide contributors with the resources and support needed to go live on mainnet. In this first phase of the grant program, we will support the development of integrations with Aztec Connect - including bridge contracts, tooling, and analytics.

Current focus
Requested bridges
Our rollups interact directly with smart contracts on mainnet through a bridge contract that models an asynchronous token swap.
https://www.notion.so/edbc53bd10ee4ae49ea0bb0756a32bbf support top use cases and will be integrated on zk.money.

Proposed bridges
Proposed bridges may execute on a single dapp or multiple DeFi transactions across dapps. Bridge contracts enable ""recipes,"" which complete multiple steps atomically. Proposed bridges will be considered for zk.money integration.

Tooling and analytics
We are looking to make it simple and delightful to build and interact with Aztec. This includes building developer tooling and dashboards (i.e. detailed metrics about usage on Dune Analytics) to improve the experience.

Grants process

Step 1: Review the https://www.notion.so/edbc53bd10ee4ae49ea0bb0756a32bbf
Aztec identified the critical bridge contracts needed for select dapps. You are also invited to propose a bridge contract that will grow the Aztec ecosystem.

Step 2: Submit your grant application
Our grant application seeks to learn about you and what you're looking to build. You can select a requested bridge contract you'll develop, or submit a proposal.

Step 3: Meet the Aztec team
Within one week of submission, the Aztec team will contact applicants for a screening call to discuss the project plan (timeline, milestones, outcomes) and support needed.

Step 4: Notification and next steps
All applicants will be notified whether their application has been accepted or denied. For proposals, we'll indicate whether the bridge contract would be integrated into http://zk.money/.

Step 5: Ongoing communication
We will establish regular check-ins and expected timeline to launch. Grantees will receive dedicated technical support to get from spec to production.

Step 6: Launch Your Project 🎉
When you're ready to ship, we’ll support your launch onto http://zk.money/ and share your work with the community. We will also offer priority access to our preferred auditor.

Program support and benefits

Office hours: The core team will be available to answer questions and troubleshoot any issues that arise as you are building. We will host weekly office hours on Discord that are open to the public, as well as two hours for individualized office hours per week.

Budget: Requested bridge contracts have a $2,000 bounty, which will be paid out to grantees who successfully deploy. Applicants may also indicate the budget required in the application - this may include compensation for the time spent on building the contract or reimbursement for expenses to deploy a bridge contract.

Exposure: Deployed bridge contracts will be featured on a leaderboard, which will showcase the number of live bridge contracts and their usage. Grant recipients will also be invited to present on Aztec community calls and receive assistance from our team to promote the integration to other relevant communities.

Audits: We are partnering with an auditor to review community written bridge contracts. Aztec will pre-fund these audit costs and the community will be involved in prioritizing which bridge contracts will be audited.",,Aztec,EVM,,Ongoing,"Devs, Infrastructure, Researchers, Universal Tools",,https://aztecnetwork.notion.site/Aztec-Grants-19896948e74b4024a458cdeddbe9574f

1. Scalability and interoperability of blockchains: Scalability is a huge barrier to adoption. Current development varies between layer 2 protocols, and has different consensus mechanisms and layer 1 structures. While much of this work has high monetary value, we are specifically looking to fund novel approaches and applications which are not so easily monetized (for example: rollups that originate in math/graph theories).

2. Privacy, Identity, and Zero Knowledge research: Financial privacy is a critical and necessary development for a widespread, safe adoption of crypto. In a world where personal privacy is increasingly at risk, we recognize that the public and permanent broadcasting of transaction history can be concerning. We are open to any applications related to this area, but we are particularly interested in development related to composable privacy — privacy preservation which can be combined with smart contract ecosystems. For example, this may lend itself to academic zero knowledge research.

3. Protocol security, audit research, developer experience, and other foundational infrastructure: The crypto-economy should be safe for all users, and this is only possible when the protocols themselves are verifiably safe. This could take the form of a better developer experience, so that common bugs are easier to avoid, better audit tooling, or even work like Solidify, our static analysis tool. To this end, we’re looking for projects which improve the foundational security of contracts, prevent exploits, and otherwise do the needful, inglorious, sometimes non-monetizable work.

4. Environmental footprint: For the crypto-economy to have a place in the mainstream, it must be sustainable. While there is https://blog.coinbase.com/fact-check-is-bitcoin-mining-environmentally-unfriendly-3559823af6f1, there’s no debate that mining is energy-intensive. We’re excited to see applications with innovative solutions to address this generational challenge.

5. Wild card: If you are working on a foundational improvement and are finding it hard to get funding, we want to hear from you!

Ecosystem grants aim at encouraging and developing the Curve, Vyper language and more generally the DeFi ecosystem. They are for individuals, teams of all sizes looking to develop tools, projects that could benefit from grants.
The following criteria are considered:
• How it relates to Curve and the Curve DAO
• How it may benefit and impact the Curve and the Curve community
• State of the project (is it some gibberish on a napkin or already in production)
• The team and how likely they are to deliver
• Potential (viability, longevity, competition and so on)
• How the funds will be used and why they are needed

These grants are quite flexible in how they are awarded with demonstrating benefit to the Curve system being most important. Existing and completed projects are also eligible particularly if they can demonstrate benefit to the ecosystem.
A council of team and community members will be formed to assign those grants which may involve milestone based repeat payments depending on the scope of the project.

Projects will have the opportunity to present their project on Curve Discord if they wish.

What is an Open Grant?

An open grant is a smart contract on Ethereum that forwards any funds that it receives to a defined list of recipients. The contract’s constructor parameters are grantees (list of recipients), amounts (how much to allocate to each grantee) and currency (currently only supports ETH).

Grants are intended to support contributors working on projects that enhance the Ethereum ecosystem. It’s meant for open-source developers, designers, researchers, writers – anyone who is contributing to the broader Ethereum roadmap.

Once logged in, open the menu and click “Create Grant”. Complete the form, keeping in mind that once a grant is created these details cannot be changed. For the project description, provide a high-level overview of the project, specifically how this grant will benefit the Ethereum ecosystem. For the project link we recommend you point to a webpage, blog post or document that covers things like scope of the project, goals, timeline, and funding goals. Once you’re ready, click “Create Grant” which will initiate a transaction to complete the action. Note that once a grant is created, its details cannot be modified.

Grantees may receive funds by one-off donations or over a longer duration with streams. You can view any grant that you’re a recipient of on the “My Grants” page to see the available balance. Anyone can distribute vested funds to grant recipients by clicking the “distribute” button and following the prompts, or by calling the withdraw function on a stream.

Osmosis Grants,,https://grants.osmosis.zone/apply-here,,"June 10, 2022 1:46 PM","What is the Osmosis Grants Program?
The Osmosis Grants Program (OGP) was created to award $5k-$500k of funding to Osmosis community members for the completion of value-add tasks which may be too small to be funded through a governance proposal. 
We believe the community needs to start spending the Community Pool’s funds aggressively to encourage experimentation and innovation, grow the ecosystem, and onboard full-time contributors that could increase the value of the protocol by hundreds of millions of dollars.
A grants program is an efficient, low cost way to do this –– by empowering community participants and supporting teams building applications which leverage the Osmosis stack. 

How do I apply?
Fill out https://grants.osmosis.zone/apply-here application form. The application will only be shared with the Program Lead and members of the Reviewer Committee. The Lead will contact you directly if the application is successfully considered for a Grant.

How will I be compensated?
The Program Lead will work with you to establish possible milestones that could help split up the compensation so as to allow payment whenever a milestone is hit.
If no milestones can be determined, the Grant will be paid a portion upfront to cover costs and the remaining total once the grant is successfully completed.💡
All payments will be made in OSMO or USDC
If you would like to get paid in OSMO and are asking for a fixed dollar amount of compensation, the number of OSMO you will receive will be determined by the price of OSMO at the time of payment. 

Can I apply as a U.S. based person/company?
Yes!❗
Please note that all applicants who are located in the United States will receive payments in USDC instead of OSMO (due to legal concerns)

What type of project will qualify for a grant?
Anything that benefits Osmosis’ product and/or its community! 
There are numerous functions that can be funded through grants, such as analytics, tooling, infrastructure, growth and many more. Furthermore, the OGP can also fund ecosystem projects that are complementary to the core product of Osmosis, such as DeFi apps leveraging Osmosis’ AMMs and Osmosis-themed gaming/NFT projects.

In addition to the externally audited smart contracts, 0x also offers developer tools tailored to the ecosystem and open-access to a pool of shared liquidity.Developers can integrate with 0x at the smart contract or application layer."," https://forms.gle/xkhsE8W7jDHuHCK8A 26",,"June 10, 2022 1:46 PM","Funding Priorities
Generally speaking, we prefer opportunities that have the potential to grow protocol volume exponentially via win/win partnerships with balanced risk/reward.
Specifically, we have identified the following areas for prioritization:
• Projects that increase 0x protocol volume (preference for orderbook-based volume)
• Projects building on 0x protocol and Polygon
• Protocol feature development (for example, integrating NFT support from v3 into v4)
• Non-DeFi business models and use cases (social, games, etc.)
• Research, simulation, and analytics related to tokenomics design
• Branding strategy
• Community engagement
• Developer engagement and support

Funding and Decisionmaking Authority
The 0x community recently approved the 0x Ecosystem Value Experiment (0xEVE) and allocated an operating budget of 400K ZRX from the Treasury. 0xEVE has the authority to award grants that can be funded with its own budget. Given the current budget valuation, these will be smaller grants (<$50K). Larger grants (>$50K) will be awarded from Treasury funds and will require community approval via an onchain vote. In some cases, 0xEVE may award a grant for a prototype or MVP in advance of a larger award being proposed for community approval at a later date.

ZRX Requirements
There is no requirement to hold ZRX to apply for or propose a grant. However, submitting a proposal for a community vote requires the submitter to hold (or be delegated) 100K ZRX. For a proposal to be approved, it must meet the minimum threshold of 10M ZRX affirmative votes and the majority of all votes.

Process Flow
There are two paths that grants can follow. The first is through the 0xEVE team via an application form (small grants) and the second is directly to the 0x community via the governance forum (large grants). The 0xEVE team will evaluate and score grants proposed in the forum (similar to, but less complex than, the MakerDAO collateral onboarding framework).

Step 1: Grant seekers apply for funding using the https://forms.gle/xkhsE8W7jDHuHCK8A or posting on the https://gov.0x.org/c/governance/. If posting on the forum, please provide the same information required in the application form.
• For grants < $50K, use the https://forms.gle/xkhsE8W7jDHuHCK8A
• For grants > $50K, post in the https://gov.0x.org/c/governance/ and in https://snapshot.org/#/0xgov.ethNote: If you are thinking about applying for a grant of more than $50K but aren’t ready to post a proposal in the forum, please submit your idea using the application form to start a conversation with our team!
Step 2: 0xEVE team begins evaluation and contacts grant seekers if additional information or negotiation is needed. 0xEVE team may award grants that fall within its budgetary authority or publish evaluation and scoring for community consideration. Grant seekers should monitor the governance forum to provide additional information and feedback as needed.Note: If 0xEVE declines or is unable to fund a grant <$50k, grant seekers can post a proposal on the forum to request funding from the Treasury.
Step 3 : After a reasonable time period has passed to allow for community discussion and 0xEVE scoring (we suggest a minimum of 14 days), along with temperature check signalling from Snapshot, proposals may proceed to a vote (see ZRX Requirements, above).
For awarded grants, funding will be disbursed in accordance with milestones or other metric/accountability criteria, such as KPIs.",https://discord.com/invite/FduK2mE,0x,EVM,,Ongoing,"Community Building/Content Creation, DAOs, Dapps, Devs, Events/Hackathons, Infrastructure, NFTs, Researchers, UI/UX, Universal Tools",https://twitter.com/0xProject,https://gov.0x.org/t/0xdao-grant-program-framework-v1/962

Normal turnaround time: 14 days

• Voting Process
Our discussions and voting are currently held within Discord through a poll bot.
The committee has been requiring 4 of 6 votes to advance a grant to next stage.

The next stage of growth for the DAO will require formalizing the approach to rewarding and incentivizing community members for their contributions across several categories.

The goal of the Tribe DAO Grants is to widen the base of contributors that make up our community and put more TRIBE in the hands of the people building Fei and Rari. We believe that a well-executed grants program is integral to making the Tribe more decentralized and resilient.

Grant categories:

Education and Transparency
Make it easier to onboard new community members, stay up to date on governance and provide greater transparency on the inner workings of the protocol.
Examples: tutorials, newsletters, podcasts, onboarding guides and up-to-date information sources about governance, PCV allocation, etc.

Usability
Enhance the protocol’s accessibility and ease of use.
Examples: new decentralized clients for the protocol, websites that allow new functionality, and analytics dashboards.

Tooling
Improve the developer experience.
Examples: CLIs, scripts and visualizations.

Research and Development
Help the Tribe stay ahead of the curve by doing research. This could include research on new peg mechanisms, figuring out how to improve oracle performance, etc. In particular, R&D implies that the work being done is in the initial stages of investigating and figuring out the structure of what needs to be done to strengthen the protocols. Deliverables may be a whitepaper, bluepaper or charter that can be developed into proof-of-concept functionality for future implementation.

Request for Proposals
The core team and the community grants committee will publish a list of proposals they would like to see funded. You can find these in the https://www.notion.so/1030a5ec1f4b4265a5e6699d1c77d17d section.
